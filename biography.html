        <h2>A charmed & tragic life</h2>

        <h3>Austria</h3>
        <p>At 15, Austrian teen Marie Antoinette became queen – and the most hated woman in France.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Maria Antonia Josefa Johanna von Habsburg Lothringen was born on Nov. 2, 1755, one of 16 children. Her
            mother, Archduchess Maria Theresa, was an important and well-respected political figure in Europe. Maria and
            boy composer Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart were childhood friends, and it was rumoured that he wanted to marry
            her. But young Maria was promised in marriage to French prince Louis Auguste in hopes of creating an
            alliance between Austria and France, two countries which had previously been locked in war. </p>
        <br>
        <p>The great irony of Maria’s life was this; she was never meant to marry into the grand role of Queen. As one
            of 16 children, Maria had a wealth of older sisters that their mother could use to make advantageous matches
            but death, illness and the scourge of smallpox meant that four of Maria’s sisters were unable to make
            matches so the expectation to marry into an illustrious royal family fell to Maria. </p>
        <br>
        <h3>France</h3>
        <p>At 14, Maria tearfully left home. </p>
        <br>
        <p>At the Austrian border, all her possessions, even the clothes she was wearing, were taken from her and she
            stepped naked over the border into France. She was even forced to leave behind her beloved dog. Her name was
            changed to Marie Antoinette (because it sounded more French) and she and Louis Auguste were married a few
            hours later. Neither of the youths was prepared for married life or the monarchy they would soon inherit.
            The young Queen found it difficult to adjust to French court life. Privacy was not an option; a flock of
            courtiers surrounded Marie Antoinette from the moment she woke, to the moment she lay down to sleep. </p>
        <br>
        <p>When Louis XV died suddenly, the teenage couple found themselves king and queen of France. The lavish
            coronation took place at the height of a bread shortage, stoking resentment against the Royal family and
            their exuberant spending. On 24 May 1774, two weeks after the death of Louis XV, the king gave his wife the
            Petit Trianon, a small château on the grounds of Versailles that had been built by Louis XV for his
            mistress, Madame de Pompadour. Louis XVI allowed Marie Antoinette to renovate it to suit her own tastes;
            soon rumours circulated that she had plastered the walls with gold and diamonds. </p>
        <br>
        <h3>Money, Money, Money</h3>
        <p>When hungry peasants stormed the palace demanding bread, Marie Antoinette was quoted as saying, “Let them eat
            cake.” She never uttered the infamous phrase, but the campaign against her had begun. The phrase had been
            previously attributed to many women before Marie-Antoinette was even born. </p>
        <br>
        <p>Marie Antoinette drew public anger by spending large sums of money on clothes, jewels, and parties. What else
            was a rich young girl to do? Members of the French Royal family were encouraged to lead lavish lives as a
            way of asserting dominance over the French public and rival royal families. Historians have also noted that
            the French Queen’s spending was likely due to the loneliness she felt as a foreign Queen trapped within the
            suffocating confines of the French court. Marie Antoinette was blamed for the country’s financial problems,
            which were, in fact, inherited from Louis XV. The young queen was publicly portrayed in pamphlets as a
            frivolous woman who was indifferent to the suffering of her people. The pamphlets accused the Queen of
            adultery, homosexuality and harbouring a lingering loyalty to her homeland of Austria. </p>
        <br>
        <h3>Death</h3>
        <p>To make matters worse, the king had a medical problem that prevented him from fathering a child, but Marie
            was blamed for not producing the heir that would cement the alliance between Austria and France. The royal
            couple’s marriage was not consummated for seven years, which made Marie Antoinette not only the target of
            the French court’s gossip but also made her the problem child of Archduchess Maria Theresa, who regularly
            berated her daughter in letters for lacking in sexual attraction. </p>
        <br>
        <p>Seven years into their marriage, Louis had an operation that allowed him to father children and he and Marie
            finally had a daughter whom they named Marie Therese. The Queen’s second pregnancy ended when she miscarried
            in 1779. The couple had three more children, Louis Joseph, Louis Charles, and Sophie Beatrix. Tragedy struck
            less than a year later when Sophie, who had been born prematurely, died. In the summer of 1789, Marie and
            Louis were devastated when heir Louis Joseph died, aged just seven. A bright but sickly child, he likely
            died from tuberculosis of the spine. Although Marie Antoinette was known as a loving mother and a supportive
            spouse, the public still hated her.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>The Diamond Scandal</h3>
        <p>Then came that scandal that sealed the Queen’s fate. Offered an expensive diamond necklace, Marie Antoinette
            refused it, saying the money would be better used to help France’s army. A scheming countess, however,
            forged the Queen’s signature, took the necklace and ran off. After a sensational trial, the countess was
            found guilty of theft, flogged, branded, and imprisoned. Even so, Marie Antoinette was tarnished by the
            scandal as blame was still cast upon her. The so-called Diamond Necklace Affair ended any chance of public
            favour forever.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>The Revolution</h3>
        <p>The beginnings of a revolution were erupting all over France and Marie believed that her family should escape
            immediately but her husband refused. A Paris prison called The Bastille was seized on July 14, 1789, marking
            the start of the French Revolution and the inevitable end of the monarchy.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Marie again begged her husband to leave and again he refused. Several plots were hatched to have the Queen
            escape with her surviving children, but she would not leave without her husband. On Oct. 5, the Palace of
            Versailles was stormed, and the family was taken as prisoners. They tried to escape, but they loaded their
            get-away carriage with so many possessions that it could barely move. They were caught and returned to
            prison.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Excecution</h3>
        <p>After many months under house arrest, Louis XVI was tried and found guilty of treason. He was beheaded on
            Jan. 17, 1793, with a new execution device – the guillotine. Marie Antoinette was heartbroken. While the
            Queen was initially allowed to remain with her children, authorities soon separated them. Marie Antoinette
            was kept under strict surveillance. Her son, Louis-Charles, was locked in a dark, fetid chamber where he was
            fed meagre rations, prevented from seeing any outside visitors and physically abused by his jailers. His
            sister, Marie Therese, was kept in a nearby cell and was forced to listen to her brother’s screams as he was
            regularly beaten but she was powerless to help him. </p>
        <br>
        <p>Isolated and scared, the boy began to display signs of emotional instability, likely exacerbated by the false
            accusation he was forced to tell by his jailers that he had been sexually molested by his mother and aunt,
            Louis XVI’s sister. That false evidence was used during the Queen’s trial, a charge his heartbroken mother
            fiercely denied. Following a gruelling two-day trial, Marie Antoinette was found guilty of crimes against
            the state and followed her husband to the guillotine on October 16, 1793. The Queen’s hair was cut short,
            and her hands tied behind her. She was led to the guillotine in an open cart through the streets.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Before her beheading, the 37-year-old Queen apologized for stepping on her executioner’s foot as she walked
            up the stairs. Less than two years after her public execution, in June 1795, 10-year-old Louis-Charles died,
            likely from tuberculosis worsened by his mistreatment.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Judgement</h3>
        <p>Today, history mostly recognizes Marie Antoinette as being terribly misrepresented and unfairly judged and
            for having shown great courage toward the end of her short life. She was the last Queen of France.</p>
