        <h1>The Truth</h1>
            <p>Marie-Antoinette is one of history’s most misunderstood figures. Both in life and death, the French Queen has been mischaracterised as a spoilt, vapid, feather-head; the kind of royal family member who learns of children starving in the streets of France and carelessly replies, ‘let them eat cake.’ 
                But the crucial thing about Marie-Antoinette’s infamous cake line and much of the lore surrounding the legend of the Queen is this; it was a dangerous fiction. A story fabricated to sell pamphlets (a precursor of our modern-day tabloids) and stoke resentment against a foreign Queen who became the scapegoat of the French Revolution.  
                Throughout this website, the lies surrounding Marie-Antoinette have been stripped away, leaving only the facts. These facts detail a life tainted by tragedy, constant pressure, and death; painting a story of how misinformation cost Marie-Antoinette not only her reputation, it cost the Queen her head.

                <p>
                    When told that starving French peasants lacked any bread to eat, the queen is alleged to have
                    callously declared, “Let them eat cake!” There is no evidence, however, that Marie Antoinette ever
                    uttered that famous quip.

                <p>
                    Marie-Antoniette was not French. Born in Vienna, Austria, in 1755, Archduchess Marie Antoinette was the 15th child of Holy Roman
                    Emperor Francis I and the powerful Habsburg Empress Maria Theresa.

                <p>
                    In a series of pamphlets written between the 1770s and her death in 1793, Marie-Antoinette was
                    portrayed as a frivolous and extravagant spendthrift and lesbian, an incestuous and bloodthirsty
                    libertine, a poisoner and infant murderess.

                <p>
                    Marie-Antoinette was not always unpopular. Unlike during her years as queen, Marie Antoinette captivated the French public in her early years
                    in the country. When the teenager made her initial appearance in the French capital, a crowd of
                    50,000 Parisians grew so uncontrollable that at least 30 people were trampled to death in the crush.
