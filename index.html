                <hr>
                <p>
                    When told that starving French peasants lacked any bread to eat, the queen is alleged to have
                    callously declared, “Let them eat cake!” There is no evidence, however, that Marie Antoinette ever
                    uttered that famous quip.

                <p>
                    Born in Vienna, Austria, in 1755, Archduchess Marie Antoinette was the 15th child of Holy Roman
                    Emperor Francis I and the powerful Habsburg Empress Maria Theresa.

                <hr>
                <p>
                    In a series of pamphlets written between the 1770s and her death in 1793, Marie-Antoinette was
                    portrayed as a frivolous and extravagant spendthrift and lesbian, an incestuous and bloodthirsty
                    libertine, a poisoner and infant murderess.

                <p>
                    Unlike during her years as queen, Marie Antoinette captivated the French public in her early years
                    in the country. When the teenager made her initial appearance in the French capital, a crowd of
                    50,000 Parisians grew so uncontrollable that at least 30 people were trampled to death in the crush.
