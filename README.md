<h1>Portfolio Project 1 - HTML/CSS Essentials </h1>
<br>


'Marie Antoinette - The true story of her life a death' is a website that dispels the myths surrounding the historical figure, Marie Antoinette, by documenting the facts surrounding her life. This site was created for anyone eager to learn a lesser known side of Marie Antoinette's story. By showcasing the young Queen as a real person in both images and video, this site offers its audience the chance to see Marie-Antionette as a living, breathing person and by doing so, empathize with a young woman whose life was smeared by both past and present day misinformation.
